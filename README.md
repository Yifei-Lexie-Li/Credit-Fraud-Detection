# üè¶üí≥Credit Card Fraud Detection 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset, where only a small fraction of transactions are fraudulent. By applying machine learning algorithms and addressing the challenges of imbalanced data, this system aims to accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## üö¶ Tools & Key Features 
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn**: For data manipulation, model training, and evaluation.
- **SMOTE**: For handling imbalanced data by oversampling fraudulent transactions.
- **Logistic Regression with Regularization**: Used for classification with regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For visualizations and performance analysis.

## üß© Key Highlights 
1. **Class Imbalance Handling**: Used SMOTE to oversample fraudulent transactions and balance the dataset.
2. **Model Performance**: Logistic Regression with regularization achieved optimal classification results.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Focused on precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance beyond accuracy.
4. **Financial Loss Calculation**: Incorporated cost-based evaluation by calculating potential financial loss from false positives and false negatives.
